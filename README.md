### Architecture
* Eureka Server (eurekaserver): The server who manages the location of all microservices.
* API Gateway (apigateway): A Gateway who redirects all requests to microservices and load balancing.
* Car Microservice (ms-cars): An service who deals with CRUD registering cars.
* Race Microservice (ms-races): An service who deals with simulating races getting info from ms-cars and send the race historic to ms-history
* History Microservice (ms-history): An service who deals with message calls from ms-races to give the history of the race, writing this message in a database.
* RabbitMQ: A queue message to deal with microservices exchanging
* MongoDB: A database to save all the information.
